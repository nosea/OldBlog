# Introduction
    什么是LFS，BLFS，ALFS，CLFS，HLFS
<!--more-->
# Content
## LFS
    Linux From Scratch(LFS)is a project that provides you with step-by-step 
	instructions for building your own customized Linux system entirely from source.
## BLFS
    Beyond Linux From Scratch (BLFS) is a project that continues where the LFS 
	book finishes. It assists users in developing their systems according to their 
	needs by providing a broad range of instructions for installing and configuring 
	various packages on top of a base LFS system.
## ALFS
    Automated Linux From Scratch (ALFS) is a project that creates the generic framework
	for an extendable system builder and package installer.
## CLFS
    Cross Linux From Scratch (CLFS) is a project that provides you with step-by-step instructions
	for building your own customized Linux system entirely from source.
	跟LFS的区别就是CLFS是包含了多个平台，更加全面，而LFS针对x86平台
## HLFS
    Hardened Linux From Scratch (HLFS)is a project that provides you with step-by-step 
	instructions for building your own customized and hardened Linux system entirely from source.
	跟LFS一样，也是基于x86平台的，区别是HLFS更加侧重安全性
	The main differences from these other projects will be the amount of text dealing with 
	security configuration issues as well as patching or substituting many of the packages used 
	for improved security.
